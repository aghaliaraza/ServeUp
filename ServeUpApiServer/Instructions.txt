---Serving more than just localhost---

If you want to listen to all requests coming in a certain port -- not just localhost requests, you'll need to know a few things.

First, understand there are permission differences between Local System, Local service, Network service, and a user account. I recommend you run under 'Local service' because it's a minimal set of permissions.

Second, you'll need to change the code that starts the service. Instead of listening for requests to http://localhost:9000, you'll need to listen for requests to http://+:9000.

Third, you'll need to use the command-line tool netsh to authorize 'Local Service' to listen for requests. I usually put this command in the install.bat file that installs the service:

netsh http add urlacl url=http://+:9000/ user="Local Service"
Without this, you'll have problems starting the service and listening to all requests for that port.
